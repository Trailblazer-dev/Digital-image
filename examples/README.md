# Digital Image Processing Examples

This directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to use the digital image processing library.

## Available Examples

- `basic_example.py`: Demonstrates basic image operations, filtering, and transformations

## Running the Examples

1. Make sure you have activated the virtual environment:
   ```
   source ../venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   ```

2. Run the examples directly:
   ```
   python basic_example.py
   ```

## Sample Images

The scripts will automatically download a sample image if none is found. You can also:

1. Add your own images to the `sample_images` directory
2. Provide a full path to an image when prompted
3. Place image files directly in this examples directory

For best results, use standard image formats like JPG, PNG, or BMP.
